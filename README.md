# ImperialUnits

Unit conversion system

### TODO: 
* Decouple everything related to UnitConversion from UI
* Expand what is today simply a string to denote which type of unit and system it belongs to
  * Add possibility to convert between systems (ex. from metric length to imperial) 
* much much more :)
